Option -T does not have any effect with the sequential or parallel MPI version.
It is used to specify the number of threads for the Pthreads-based parallelization

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 5 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file output_test3/various_outputs/c_GOUB13802.g1.phy.reduced


You are using RAxML version 7.1.0 released by Alexandros Stamatakis in March 2009

RAxML classifier Algo: You provided a reference tree with 233 taxa; alignmnet has 234 taxa
1 query taxa will be classifed under ML

RAxML Classification Algorithm search parameters:
Insertion using dynamic Alignment: NO
Thorough  Insertion Method with branch length optimization: YES
Bootstrap insertions with heuristics: NO

GAMMA based Likelihood score of reference tree: -39536.683609

RAxML will classify 1 Query Sequences into the 463 branches of the reference tree with 233 taxa

Overall Classification time: 19.749867
