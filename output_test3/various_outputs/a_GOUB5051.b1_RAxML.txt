Option -T does not have any effect with the sequential or parallel MPI version.
It is used to specify the number of threads for the Pthreads-based parallelization


You are using RAxML version 7.1.0 released by Alexandros Stamatakis in March 2009

Alignment has 1129 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 0.079341

RAxML classification algorithm

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heteorgeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

Partition: 0

RAxML classifier Algo: You provided a reference tree with 176 taxa; alignmnet has 177 taxa
1 query taxa will be classifed under ML

RAxML Classification Algorithm search parameters:
Insertion using dynamic Alignment: NO
Thorough  Insertion Method with branch length optimization: YES
Bootstrap insertions with heuristics: NO

GAMMA based Likelihood score of reference tree: -58903.097536

RAxML will classify 1 Query Sequences into the 349 branches of the reference tree with 176 taxa

Overall Classification time: 24.750731
